You are given sequence x which contains 0 ≤ N ≤ 105 integer numbers: 0 ≤ xi < 10000. You need to calculate length of Longest Increasing Subsequence of this sequence.
Increasing subsequence of sequence x = x0, x1, ..., xN-1 is:

You need to find maximum possible K.

## Input format

First line of input file contains single integer number: 0 ≤ N ≤ 105 — length of initial sequence.
Second line contains N integer numbers divided by space character: 0 ≤ xi < 10000 — initial sequence.


## Output format

Print single integer number K — length of longest increasing subsequence in x.
