MSAI teachers continue to analyse results of this year courses. And again, they can't do without your help!
This time number of students was 0 ≤ N ≤ 100000, and teachers want to check if courses were too easy or too difficult. To do that they need to check number of students whose average score is within given range: l ≤ score ≤ r.
Please, help the teachers and write the program which can process such requests fast. The number of requests teachers prepared for you is 0 ≤ M ≤ 100000.

## Input format

First line contains two integer numbers divided by space character: 0 ≤ N, M ≤ 100000 — number of students and requests respectively. Second line contains N numbers divided by space character: scores of students. 0 ≤ si ≤ 109. Each of the following M lines contains two integer numbers: lj, rj, divided by space character: 0 ≤ lj ≤ rj ≤ 109
 
## Output format

For each request (lj, rj) print one integer number on separate line: number of students who got score within requested range: .
